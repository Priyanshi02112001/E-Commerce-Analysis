To align myself with market demands, I recently dove into A/B Testing‚Äîa crucial skill in the world of data-driven decision-making.

## Real-World Scenario: A/B Testing Results Are In!
I ran a hypothesis test comparing two website designs: Design A vs. Design B, focusing on average time spent on the site.

## The results?
The Z-score exceeded the critical value, meaning it landed in the rejection region. So, we rejected the null hypothesis.

## üîç Conclusion:
Design B significantly increases user engagement compared to Design A.
